# Versity
## About the project

Versity App will be a companion app for university students which will help them with academics and socials, the two aspects of university that our team believes an ‘all-rounder’ student should excel in.

For academics, our app will help students organize their daily schedule. In our university, students are part of classes which have the same schedule, hence the users will be able to join their class’s group in the app. The class’s schedule will show up in the user’s personal calendar view.

For socials, our app will help students be an active part of different societies in their university. It is usually hard to keep track of all the different events, meetings, practices of the societies/clubs that one has joined. Through our app, the society heads can make groups for the society and 
Other than these two aspects, our users will also be able to add items to their personal schedules which will also appear in their calendar view. :)
